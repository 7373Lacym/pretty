# pretty

Various [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBYgq6jPoyk) have been published as tutorials on how to datamine results of crossreff api call.  Most of them use a `pretty`
script in order to extract the full text urls but then do not link to the actual script they use. This was very confusing.  A script that does something
similar can be found here.
